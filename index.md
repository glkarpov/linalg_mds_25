# Linear algebra

* Course for students of the online "Master of Data Science" program, implemented at the Faculty of Computer Science, HSE University.
* The course is adaptive and aims both to introduce students to the fundamental topics of linear algebra: vector spaces, bases, linear mappings - and to demonstrate the emergence of these concepts in the practical application of linear algebra in data science and machine learning.
